# -Out-of-Order-Pipeline-Simulation

This project implements a performance evaluation of an out-of-order pipeline with in-order commit, including register renaming and scheduling algorithms. Tasks include creating Register Alias Table (RAT) and Reorder Buffer (ROB), integrating them into a 1-wide pipeline, and extending it to a 2-wide superscalar pipeline for additional complexity.
